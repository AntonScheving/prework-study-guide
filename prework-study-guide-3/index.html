        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</li>
          <li>In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way of declaring variables and that was using the <span><strong>var</strong></span> keyword. A variable declared with <span><strong>var</strong></span> is defined throughout the program. One of the issues with using the <span><strong>var</strong></span> keyword was redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block</li>
          <li>With the introduction of ES6 in 2015 two more keywords, <span><strong>let</strong></span> and <span><strong>const</strong></span> came into the picture. var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that <span><strong>var</strong></span> is function scoped and let is block scoped. Variable declared by let cannot be redeclared and must be declared before use whereas variables declared with <span><strong>var</strong></span> keyword are hoisted.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
